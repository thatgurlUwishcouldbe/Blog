# From Genshin Impact Addiction to a Game Development Dream 

In 2020, I was completely immersed in Genshin Impact—a game that consumed my time and mind entirely. I spent hours exploring Teyvat, chasing characters, and searching for the best combat combinations. It wasn’t just a game for me; it was my gateway to a whole new world—the world of technology and programming.  

Over time, I started wondering,How was a game this beautiful and detailed created? That’s when my passion shifted beyond just playing, and I decided to pursue Information Technology to understand how these virtual worlds are built. Today, as I walk the path of programming, my goal is clear: to become a game developer and create worlds that amaze others just as Genshin Impact once amazed me.
